		<h1>About Lab 2</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to show that I can create links with absolute and relative paths, how to create and format a table, and how to create an email format. I demonstrate my skills by 
		setting up a table with multiple cells that provide links with absolute and relative paths to other web pages such as the link to the home page or the link providing a format to send an email.
		For example, I was able to link a different page to this project called lab2-home using a relative path whereas I used an absolute path to link to external websites. I am also able to use 
		another link to create an email.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>This table displays various links to test absolute and relative paths</th>
				<td><a href="lab2-home.html">Lab 2 - Home (Relative)</a></td>
				<td><a 
				href="mailto:example@gmail.com?cc=person@rapidtables.com&bcc=person2@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
				Send an email with cc, bcc, subject, and body
